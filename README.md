zombie-dodger: We're building the future of Human-Agentic AI Interaction that allows humans to dial in and help game play for Agentic Characters and help them out in winning  and surviving Zombie Apocalype. 


What if there's we replicate real life games in the world of agents, and build collaborative Human- AI agent dial in game. 

Each Character would have its own Agency to survice and replication of real world physics. Humans can interact with voice in real time. And help out these characters to escape and win.
